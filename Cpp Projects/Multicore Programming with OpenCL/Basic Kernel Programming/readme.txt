Each subtask is stored in a subfolder, whose SourceCode subfolder contains the header files, .cpp files and .cl file necessary to run the program.

Also, each subtask is a separate program itself. Thus, all subtasks come with their own driver source code files. Please compile them separately.

Screenshots are also included to demonstrate the output of the program in the console.
