Each task is stored in a subfolder, whose "source files" subfolder contains the header files, .cpp files and .cl file necessary to run the program.

Also, each task is a separate program itself. Thus, all tasks come with their own driver source code files. Please compile them separately.

Screenshots are also included to demonstrate the output of the program.

bmpFunctions.cpp, bmpFunctions.h, common.cpp and common.h are reused from the tutorials.
